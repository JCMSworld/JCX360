John Christopher — Cloud, AI & Enterprise Architecture

Welcome. This repository hosts my personal site and professional hub, focused on modern enterprise architecture, cloud platforms, and AI systems.

My work sits at the intersection of:

Enterprise Architecture

Cloud-Native Platforms (Microsoft Azure)

AI Engineering & Multi-Agent Systems

Event-Driven Architecture

Platform Engineering & SRE

DevSecOps, Governance & Delivery Architecture

This site is designed as a simple, durable home for my thinking and professional narrative.

Architecture Focus Areas

Azure Cloud-Native Architecture

AI Orchestration & Multi-Agent Systems

Event-Driven Platforms

Landing Zones, Identity & Governance

Observability, SRE & Platform Reliability

DevSecOps & Delivery Architecture

FinOps, GreenOps & Sustainable Platforms

JCX Architecture Series

I publish a structured thought leadership series on LinkedIn covering modern enterprise architecture and AI systems. Key themes include:

AI-Powered Cloud Platforms

Azure AI Foundry & LLM Orchestration

Multi-Agent Decisioning Systems

Azure Landing Zones & Governance

Observability & Platform Operations

DevSecOps, SRE & Delivery Architecture

JCX-3S Framework (Secure • Scale • Sustain)

The goal of the series is to connect architecture, delivery, and operations into a single, coherent platform narrative.

Philosophy

Modern platforms don’t succeed on technology alone.

They succeed when:

Security is designed in, not added later

Scale is architectural, not reactive

Operations are observable, not opaque

Delivery is predictable, not heroic

Governance enables speed, not friction

Sustainability is treated as a first-class concern

This repository reflects that philosophy.
