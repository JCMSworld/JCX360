I am a Hybrid Technical Delivery Manager and Solution Architect with a little over 20 years of experience helping organisations build cloud-native, AI-enabled, and enterprise-scale platforms. My career has taken me across Europe, the US, India, and APAC, and the common thread throughout has been connecting architecture with delivery — making sure great designs actually turn into working, reliable systems.

I have led large, distributed engineering teams, modernised legacy platforms, and delivered major ERP/HCM programmes across Workday, SuccessFactors, and ADP. I have also spent a lot of time on cloud transformation, particularly on Azure, where I have designed platforms using AKS, Event Hub, Service Bus, microservices, and event-driven patterns.

On the AI side, I design practical LLM and AI workflows using Azure AI Foundry and LangChain/LangGraph, focusing on things like prompt flow orchestration, model evaluation, and explainability — all wrapped in responsible AI practices that meet GDPR, ISO 27001, SOC2, DORA and EU Sovereign Cloud expectations.

My leadership style is grounded in predictable delivery, clear governance, and strong collaboration across engineering, security, data, and business teams. I care about building teams that work well together, simplifying complex architecture, and delivering systems that are secure, resilient, and ready for real-world use.

At the end of the day, I enjoy solving complex problems and making technology work in a way that brings actual value to the organisations I partner with.
