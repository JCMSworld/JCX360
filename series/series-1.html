<h1>Series 1 — Cloud-Native & Responsible AI Foundations</h1>

<p>
This series explores how modern enterprises can design, govern, and operate
cloud-native and AI-enabled platforms in a way that is secure, scalable,
and aligned with real-world regulatory and delivery constraints.
</p>

<p>
Across these articles, I cover practical architecture patterns, responsible AI
governance, Azure platform foundations, observability, and the delivery
disciplines required to run these systems reliably at scale.
